# WAREHOUSE PROJECT

## Project Details

In this project, I build out an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. This required me to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from the staging tables I defined in the `sql_queries.py` file.

## Instructions

First, run the `sql_queries.py` file in the terminal to create the tables, once that is successful, run the etl.py file to load the staging tables and create the tables on Redshift.
